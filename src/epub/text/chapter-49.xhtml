				<p>When Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go straightway to his mountains and his cave, but made many wanderings and questionings, and ascertained this and that; so that he said of himself jestingly: “Lo, a river that floweth back unto its source in many windings!” For he wanted to learn what had taken place <em>among men</em> during the interval: whether they had become greater or smaller. And once, when he saw a row of new houses, he marvelled, and said:</p>
				<p>“What do these houses mean? Verily, no great soul put them up as its simile!</p>
				<p>“Did perhaps a silly child take them out of its toy-box? Would that another child put them again into the box!</p>
				<p>“And these rooms and chambers⁠—can <em>men</em> go out and in there? They seem to be made for silk dolls; or for dainty-eaters, who perhaps let others eat with them.”</p>
				<p>And Zarathustra stood still and meditated. At last he said sorrowfully: “There hath <em>everything</em> become smaller!</p>
				<p>“Everywhere do I see lower doorways: he who is of <em>my</em> type can still go therethrough, but⁠—he must stoop!</p>
				<p>“Oh, when shall I arrive again at my home, where I shall no longer have to stoop⁠—shall no longer have to stoop <em>before the small ones</em>!”⁠—And Zarathustra sighed, and gazed into the distance.⁠—</p>
				<p>The same day, however, he gave his discourse on the bedwarfing virtue.</p>

				<p>I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open: they do not forgive me for not envying their virtues.</p>
				<p>They bite at me, because I say unto them that for small people, small virtues are necessary⁠—and because it is hard for me to understand that small people are <em>necessary</em>!</p>
				<p>Here am I still like a cock in a strange farmyard, at which even the hens peck: but on that account I am not unfriendly to the hens.</p>
				<p>I am courteous towards them, as towards all small annoyances; to be prickly towards what is small, seemeth to me wisdom for hedgehogs.</p>
				<p>They all speak of me when they sit around their fire in the evening⁠—they speak of me, but no one thinketh⁠—of me!</p>
				<p>This is the new stillness which I have experienced: their noise around me spreadeth a mantle over my thoughts.</p>
				<p>They shout to one another: “What is this gloomy cloud about to do to us? Let us see that it doth not bring a plague upon us!”</p>
				<p>And recently did a woman seize upon her child that was coming unto me: “Take the children away,” cried she, “such eyes scorch children’s souls.”</p>
				<p>They cough when I speak: they think coughing an objection to strong winds⁠—they divine nothing of the boisterousness of my happiness!</p>
				<p>“We have not yet time for Zarathustra”⁠—so they object; but what matter about a time that “hath no time” for Zarathustra?</p>
				<p>And if they should altogether praise me, how could I go to sleep on <em>their</em> praise? A girdle of spines is their praise unto me: it scratcheth me even when I take it off.</p>
				<p>And this also did I learn among them: the praiser doeth as if he gave back; in truth, however, he wanteth more to be given him!</p>
				<p>Ask my foot if their lauding and luring strains please it! Verily, to such measure and ticktack, it liketh neither to dance nor to stand still.</p>
				<p>To small virtues would they fain lure and laud me; to the ticktack of small happiness would they fain persuade my foot.</p>
				<p>I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open; they have become <em>smaller</em>, and ever become smaller:⁠—<em>the reason thereof is their doctrine of happiness and virtue.</em></p>
				<p>For they are moderate also in virtue⁠—because they want comfort. With comfort, however, moderate virtue only is compatible.</p>
				<p>To be sure, they also learn in their way to stride on and stride forward: that, I call their <em>hobbling</em>.⁠—Thereby they become a hindrance to all who are in haste.</p>
				<p>And many of them go forward, and look backwards thereby, with stiffened necks: those do I like to run up against.</p>
				<p>Foot and eye shall not lie, nor give the lie to each other. But there is much lying among small people.</p>
				<p>Some of them <em>will</em>, but most of them are <em>willed</em>. Some of them are genuine, but most of them are bad actors.</p>
				<p>There are actors without knowing it amongst them, and actors without intending it⁠—, the genuine ones are always rare, especially the genuine actors.</p>
				<p>Of man there is little here: therefore do their women masculinise themselves. For only he who is man enough, will⁠—<em>save the woman</em> in woman.</p>
				<p>And this hypocrisy found I worst amongst them, that even those who command feign the virtues of those who serve.</p>
				<p>“I serve, thou servest, we serve”⁠—so chanteth here even the hypocrisy of the rulers⁠—and alas! if the first lord be <em>only</em> the first servant!</p>
				<p>Ah, even upon their hypocrisy did mine eyes’ curiosity alight; and well did I divine all their fly-happiness, and their buzzing around sunny windowpanes.</p>
				<p>So much kindness, so much weakness do I see. So much justice and pity, so much weakness.</p>
				<p>Round, fair, and considerate are they to one another, as grains of sand are round, fair, and considerate to grains of sand.</p>
				<p>Modestly to embrace a small happiness⁠—that do they call “submission”! and at the same time they peer modestly after a new small happiness.</p>
				<p>In their hearts they want simply one thing most of all: that no one hurt them. Thus do they anticipate everyone’s wishes and do well unto everyone.</p>
				<p>That, however, is <em>cowardice</em>, though it be called “virtue.”⁠—</p>
				<p>And when they chance to speak harshly, those small people, then do <em>I</em> hear therein only their hoarseness⁠—every draught of air maketh them hoarse.</p>
				<p>Shrewd indeed are they, their virtues have shrewd fingers. But they lack fists: their fingers do not know how to creep behind fists.</p>
				<p>Virtue for them is what maketh modest and tame: therewith have they made the wolf a dog, and man himself man’s best domestic animal.</p>
				<p>“We set our chair in the <em>midst</em>”⁠—so saith their smirking unto me⁠—“and as far from dying gladiators as from satisfied swine.”</p>
				<p>That, however, is⁠—<em>mediocrity</em>, though it be called moderation.⁠—</p>

				<p>I pass through this people and let fall many words: but they know neither how to take nor how to retain them.</p>
				<p>They wonder why I came not to revile venery and vice; and verily, I came not to warn against pickpockets either!</p>
				<p>They wonder why I am not ready to abet and whet their wisdom: as if they had not yet enough of wiseacres, whose voices grate on mine ear like slate-pencils!</p>
				<p>And when I call out: “Curse all the cowardly devils in you, that would fain whimper and fold the hands and adore”⁠—then do they shout: “Zarathustra is godless.”</p>
				<p>And especially do their teachers of submission shout this;⁠—but precisely in their ears do I love to cry: “Yea! I <em>am</em> Zarathustra, the godless!”</p>
				<p>Those teachers of submission! Wherever there is aught puny, or sickly, or scabby, there do they creep like lice; and only my disgust preventeth me from cracking them.</p>
				<p>Well! This is my sermon for <em>their</em> ears: I am Zarathustra the godless, who saith: “Who is more godless than I, that I may enjoy his teaching?”</p>
				<p>I am Zarathustra the godless: where do I find mine equal? And all those are mine equals who give unto themselves their Will, and divest themselves of all submission.</p>
				<p>I am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in <em>my</em> pot. And only when it hath been quite cooked do I welcome it as <em>my</em> food.</p>
				<p>And verily, many a chance came imperiously unto me: but still more imperiously did my <em>Will</em> speak unto it⁠—then did it lie imploringly upon its knees⁠—</p>
				<p>—Imploring that it might find home and heart with me, and saying flatteringly: “See, O Zarathustra, how friend only cometh unto friend!”⁠—</p>
				<p>But why talk I, when no one hath <em>mine</em> ears! And so will I shout it out unto all the winds:</p>
				<p>Ye ever become smaller, ye small people! Ye crumble away, ye comfortable ones! Ye will yet perish⁠—</p>
				<p>—By your many small virtues, by your many small omissions, and by your many small submissions!</p>
				<p>Too tender, too yielding: so is your soil! But for a tree to become <em>great</em>, it seeketh to twine hard roots around hard rocks!</p>
				<p>Also what ye omit weaveth at the web of all the human future; even your naught is a cobweb, and a spider that liveth on the blood of the future.</p>
				<p>And when ye take, then is it like stealing, ye small virtuous ones; but even among knaves <em>honour</em> saith that “one shall only steal when one cannot rob.”</p>
				<p>“It giveth itself”⁠—that is also a doctrine of submission. But I say unto you, ye comfortable ones, that <em>it taketh to itself</em>, and will ever take more and more from you!</p>
				<p>Ah, that ye would renounce all <em>half</em>-willing, and would decide for idleness as ye decide for action!</p>
				<p>Ah, that ye understood my word: “Do ever what ye will⁠—but first be such as <em>can will</em>.</p>
				<p>“Love ever your neighbour as yourselves⁠—but first be such as <em>love themselves</em>⁠—</p>
				<p>“⁠—Such as love with great love, such as love with great contempt!” Thus speaketh Zarathustra the godless.⁠—</p>
				<p>But why talk I, when no one hath <em>mine</em> ears! It is still an hour too early for me here.</p>
				<p>Mine own forerunner am I among this people, mine own cockcrow in dark lanes.</p>
				<p>But <em>their</em> hour cometh! And there cometh also mine! Hourly do they become smaller, poorer, unfruitfuller⁠—poor herbs! poor earth!</p>
				<p>And <em>soon</em> shall they stand before me like dry grass and prairie, and verily, weary of themselves⁠—and panting for <em>fire</em>, more than for water!</p>
				<p>O blessed hour of the lightning! O mystery before noontide!⁠—Running fires will I one day make of them, and heralds with flaming tongues:⁠—</p>
				<p>—Herald shall they one day with flaming tongues: It cometh, it is nigh, <em>the great noontide</em>!</p>
				<p>Thus spake Zarathustra.</p>
