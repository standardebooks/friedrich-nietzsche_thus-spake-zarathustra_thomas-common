			<p>My brother, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own virtue, thou hast it in common with no one.</p>
			<p>To be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou wouldst pull its ears and amuse thyself with it.</p>
			<p>And lo! Then hast thou its name in common with the people, and hast become one of the people and the herd with thy virtue!</p>
			<p>Better for thee to say: “Ineffable is it, and nameless, that which is pain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of my bowels.”</p>
			<p>Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.</p>
			<p>Thus speak and stammer: “That is <em>my</em> good, that do I love, thus doth it please me entirely, thus only do <em>I</em> desire the good.</p>
			<p>“Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human need do I desire it; it is not to be a guidepost for me to superearths and paradises.</p>
			<p>“An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and the least everyday wisdom.</p>
			<p>“But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish it⁠—now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs.”</p>
			<p>Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue.</p>
			<p>Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.</p>
			<p>Thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions: then became they thy virtues and joys.</p>
			<p>And though thou wert of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive;</p>
			<p>All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils angels.</p>
			<p>Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed at last into birds and charming songstresses.</p>
			<p>Out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy cow, affliction, milkedst thou⁠—now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her udder.</p>
			<p>And nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be the evil that groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues.</p>
			<p>My brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one virtue and no more: thus goest thou easier over the bridge.</p>
			<p>Illustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and many a one hath gone into the wilderness and killed himself, because he was weary of being the battle and battlefield of virtues.</p>
			<p>My brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is the evil; necessary are the envy and the distrust and the backbiting among the virtues.</p>
			<p>Lo! how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; it wanteth thy whole spirit to be <em>its</em> herald, it wanteth thy whole power, in wrath, hatred, and love.</p>
			<p>Jealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is jealousy. Even virtues may succumb by jealousy.</p>
			<p>He whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at last, like the scorpion, the poisoned sting against himself.</p>
			<p>Ah! my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself?</p>
			<p>Man is something that hath to be surpassed: and therefore shalt thou love thy virtues⁠—for thou wilt succumb by them.⁠—</p>
			<p>Thus spake Zarathustra.</p>
