			</hgroup>
			<p>Zarathustra’s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called “The Pied Cow,” behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra thereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake thus:</p>
			<p>“If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so.</p>
			<p>“But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it as it listeth. We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.”</p>
			<p>Thereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: “I hear Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!” Zarathustra answered:</p>
			<p>“Why art thou frightened on that account?⁠—But it is the same with man as with the tree.</p>
			<p>“The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep⁠—into the evil.”</p>
			<p>“Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth. “How is it possible that thou hast discovered my soul?”</p>
			<p>Zarathustra smiled, and said: “Many a soul one will never discover, unless one first invent it.”</p>
			<p>“Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth once more.</p>
			<p>“Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer since I sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how doth that happen?</p>
			<p>“I change too quickly: my today refuteth my yesterday. I often overleap the steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of the steps pardons me.</p>
			<p>“When aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh unto me; the frost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I seek on the height?</p>
			<p>“My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I clamber, the more do I despise him who clambereth. What doth he seek on the height?</p>
			<p>“How ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How I mock at my violent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How tired I am on the height!”</p>
			<p>Here the youth was silent. And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside which they stood, and spake thus:</p>
			<p>“This tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown up high above man and beast.</p>
			<p>“And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand it: so high hath it grown.</p>
			<p>“Now it waiteth and waiteth⁠—for what doth it wait? It dwelleth too close to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps for the first lightning?”</p>
			<p>When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with violent gestures: “Yea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth. My destruction I longed for, when I desired to be on the height, and thou art the lightning for which I waited! Lo! what have I been since thou hast appeared amongst us? It is mine envy of thee that hath destroyed me!”⁠—Thus spake the youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put his arm about him, and led the youth away with him.</p>
			<p>And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra began to speak thus:</p>
			<p>It rendeth my heart. Better than thy words express it, thine eyes tell me all thy danger.</p>
			<p>As yet thou art not free; thou still <em>seekest</em> freedom. Too unslept hath thy seeking made thee, and too wakeful.</p>
			<p>On the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth thy soul. But thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.</p>
			<p>Thy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar when thy spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors.</p>
			<p>Still art thou a prisoner⁠—it seemeth to me⁠—who deviseth liberty for himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners, but also deceitful and wicked.</p>
			<p>To purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit. Much of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him: pure hath his eye still to become.</p>
			<p>Yea, I know thy danger. But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not thy love and hope away!</p>
			<p>Noble thou feelest thyself still, and noble others also feel thee still, though they bear thee a grudge and cast evil looks. Know this, that to everybody a noble one standeth in the way.</p>
			<p>Also to the good, a noble one standeth in the way: and even when they call him a good man, they want thereby to put him aside.</p>
			<p>The new, would the noble man create, and a new virtue. The old, wanteth the good man, and that the old should be conserved.</p>
			<p>But it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man, but lest he should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.</p>
			<p>Ah! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then they disparaged all high hopes.</p>
			<p>Then lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures, and beyond the day had hardly an aim.</p>
			<p>“Spirit is also voluptuousness,”⁠—said they. Then broke the wings of their spirit; and now it creepeth about, and defileth where it gnaweth.</p>
			<p>Once they thought of becoming heroes; but sensualists are they now. A trouble and a terror is the hero to them.</p>
			<p>But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not away the hero in thy soul! Maintain holy thy highest hope!⁠—</p>
			<p>Thus spake Zarathustra.</p>
