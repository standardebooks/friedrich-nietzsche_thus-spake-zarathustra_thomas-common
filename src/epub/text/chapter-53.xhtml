			</hgroup>
			<p>O lonesomeness! My <em>home</em>, lonesomeness! Too long have I lived wildly in wild remoteness, to return to thee without tears!</p>
			<p>Now threaten me with the finger as mothers threaten; now smile upon me as mothers smile; now say just: “Who was it that like a whirlwind once rushed away from me?⁠—</p>
			<p>“⁠—Who when departing called out: ‘Too long have I sat with lonesomeness; there have I unlearned silence!’ <em>That</em> hast thou learned now⁠—surely?</p>
			<p>“O Zarathustra, everything do I know; and that thou wert <em>more forsaken</em> amongst the many, thou unique one, than thou ever wert with me!</p>
			<p>“One thing is forsakenness, another matter is lonesomeness: <em>that</em> hast thou now learned! And that amongst men thou wilt ever be wild and strange:</p>
			<p>“⁠—Wild and strange even when they love thee: for above all they want to be <em>treated indulgently</em>!</p>
			<p>“Here, however, art thou at home and house with thyself; here canst thou utter everything, and unbosom all motives; nothing is here ashamed of concealed, congealed feelings.</p>
			<p>“Here do all things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee: for they want to ride upon thy back. On every simile dost thou here ride to every truth.</p>
			<p>“Uprightly and openly mayest thou here talk to all things: and verily, it soundeth as praise in their ears, for one to talk to all things⁠—directly!</p>
			<p>“Another matter, however, is forsakenness. For, dost thou remember, O Zarathustra? When thy bird screamed overhead, when thou stoodest in the forest, irresolute, ignorant where to go, beside a corpse:⁠—</p>
			<p>“⁠—When thou spakest: ‘Let mine animals lead me! More dangerous have I found it among men than among animals:’⁠—<em>That</em> was forsakenness!</p>
			<p>“And dost thou remember, O Zarathustra? When thou sattest in thine isle, a well of wine giving and granting amongst empty buckets, bestowing and distributing amongst the thirsty:</p>
			<p>“⁠—Until at last thou alone sattest thirsty amongst the drunken ones, and wailedst nightly: ‘Is taking not more blessed than giving? And stealing yet more blessed than taking?’⁠—<em>That</em> was forsakenness!</p>
			<p>“And dost thou remember, O Zarathustra? When thy stillest hour came and drove thee forth from thyself, when with wicked whispering it said: ‘Speak and succumb!’⁠—</p>
			<p>“⁠—When it disgusted thee with all thy waiting and silence, and discouraged thy humble courage: <em>That</em> was forsakenness!”⁠—</p>
			<p>O lonesomeness! My home, lonesomeness! How blessedly and tenderly speaketh thy voice unto me!</p>
			<p>We do not question each other, we do not complain to each other; we go together openly through open doors.</p>
			<p>For all is open with thee and clear; and even the hours run here on lighter feet. For in the dark, time weigheth heavier upon one than in the light.</p>
			<p>Here fly open unto me all being’s words and word-cabinets: here all being wanteth to become words, here all becoming wanteth to learn of me how to talk.</p>
			<p>Down there, however⁠—all talking is in vain! There, forgetting and passing-by are the best wisdom: <em>that</em> have I learned now!</p>
			<p>He who would understand everything in man must handle everything. But for that I have too clean hands.</p>
			<p>I do not like even to inhale their breath; alas! that I have lived so long among their noise and bad breaths!</p>
			<p>O blessed stillness around me! O pure odours around me! How from a deep breast this stillness fetcheth pure breath! How it hearkeneth, this blessed stillness!</p>
			<p>But down there⁠—there speaketh everything, there is everything misheard. If one announce one’s wisdom with bells, the shopmen in the marketplace will out-jingle it with pennies!</p>
			<p>Everything among them talketh; no one knoweth any longer how to understand. Everything falleth into the water; nothing falleth any longer into deep wells.</p>
			<p>Everything among them talketh, nothing succeedeth any longer and accomplisheth itself. Everything cackleth, but who will still sit quietly on the nest and hatch eggs?</p>
			<p>Everything among them talketh, everything is out-talked. And that which yesterday was still too hard for time itself and its tooth, hangeth today, outchamped and outchewed, from the mouths of the men of today.</p>
			<p>Everything among them talketh, everything is betrayed. And what was once called the secret and secrecy of profound souls, belongeth today to the street-trumpeters and other butterflies.</p>
			<p>O human hubbub, thou wonderful thing! Thou noise in dark streets! Now art thou again behind me:⁠—my greatest danger lieth behind me!</p>
			<p>In indulging and pitying lay ever my greatest danger; and all human hubbub wisheth to be indulged and tolerated.</p>
			<p>With suppressed truths, with fool’s hand and befooled heart, and rich in petty lies of pity:⁠—thus have I ever lived among men.</p>
			<p>Disguised did I sit amongst them, ready to misjudge <em>myself</em> that I might endure <em>them</em>, and willingly saying to myself: “Thou fool, thou dost not know men!”</p>
			<p>One unlearneth men when one liveth amongst them: there is too much foreground in all men⁠—what can farseeing, far-longing eyes do <em>there</em>!</p>
			<p>And, fool that I was, when they misjudged me, I indulged them on that account more than myself, being habitually hard on myself, and often even taking revenge on myself for the indulgence.</p>
			<p>Stung all over by poisonous flies, and hollowed like the stone by many drops of wickedness: thus did I sit among them, and still said to myself: “Innocent is everything petty of its pettiness!”</p>
			<p>Especially did I find those who call themselves “the good,” the most poisonous flies; they sting in all innocence, they lie in all innocence; how <em>could</em> they⁠—be just towards me!</p>
			<p>He who liveth amongst the good⁠—pity teacheth him to lie. Pity maketh stifling air for all free souls. For the stupidity of the good is unfathomable.</p>
			<p>To conceal myself and my riches⁠—<em>that</em> did I learn down there: for everyone did I still find poor in spirit. It was the lie of my pity, that I knew in everyone,</p>
			<p>—That I saw and scented in everyone, what was <em>enough</em> of spirit for him, and what was <em>too much</em>!</p>
			<p>Their stiff wise men: I call them wise, not stiff⁠—thus did I learn to slur over words.</p>
			<p>The gravediggers dig for themselves diseases. Under old rubbish rest bad vapours. One should not stir up the marsh. One should live on mountains.</p>
			<p>With blessed nostrils do I again breathe mountain-freedom. Freed at last is my nose from the smell of all human hubbub!</p>
			<p>With sharp breezes tickled, as with sparkling wine, <em>sneezeth</em> my soul⁠—sneezeth, and shouteth self-congratulatingly: “Health to thee!”</p>
			<p>Thus spake Zarathustra.</p>
