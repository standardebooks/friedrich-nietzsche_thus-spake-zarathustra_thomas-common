				<p>When Zarathustra spake these sayings, he stood nigh to the entrance of his cave; with the last words, however, he slipped away from his guests, and fled for a little while into the open air.</p>
				<p>“O pure odours around me,” cried he, “O blessed stillness around me! But where are mine animals? Hither, hither, mine eagle and my serpent!</p>
				<p>“Tell me, mine animals: these higher men, all of them⁠—do they perhaps not <em>smell</em> well? O pure odours around me! Now only do I know and feel how I love you, mine animals.”</p>
				<p>—And Zarathustra said once more: “I love you, mine animals!” The eagle, however, and the serpent pressed close to him when he spake these words, and looked up to him. In this attitude were they all three silent together, and sniffed and sipped the good air with one another. For the air here outside was better than with the higher men.</p>

				<p>Hardly, however, had Zarathustra left the cave when the old magician got up, looked cunningly about him, and said: “He is gone!</p>
				<p>“And already, ye higher men⁠—let me tickle you with this complimentary and flattering name, as he himself doeth⁠—already doth mine evil spirit of deceit and magic attack me, my melancholy devil,</p>
				<p>“⁠—Which is an adversary to this Zarathustra from the very heart: forgive it for this! Now doth it wish to conjure before you, it hath just <em>its</em> hour; in vain do I struggle with this evil spirit.</p>
				<p>“Unto all of you, whatever honours ye like to assume in your names, whether ye call yourselves ‘the free spirits’ or ‘the conscientious,’ or ‘the penitents of the spirit,’ or ‘the unfettered,’ or ‘the great longers,’⁠—</p>
				<p>“⁠—Unto all of you, who like me suffer <em>from the great loathing</em>, to whom the old God hath died, and as yet no new God lieth in cradles and swaddling clothes⁠—unto all of you is mine evil spirit and magic-devil favourable.</p>
				<p>“I know you, ye higher men, I know him⁠—I know also this fiend whom I love in spite of me, this Zarathustra: he himself often seemeth to me like the beautiful mask of a saint,</p>
				<p>“⁠—Like a new strange mummery in which mine evil spirit, the melancholy devil, delighteth:⁠—I love Zarathustra, so doth it often seem to me, for the sake of mine evil spirit.⁠—</p>
				<p>“But already doth <em>it</em> attack me and constrain me, this spirit of melancholy, this evening-twilight devil: and verily, ye higher men, it hath a longing⁠—</p>
				<p>“⁠—Open your eyes!⁠—it hath a longing to come <em>naked</em>, whether male or female, I do not yet know: but it cometh, it constraineth me, alas! open your wits!</p>
				<p>“The day dieth out, unto all things cometh now the evening, also unto the best things; hear now, and see, ye higher men, what devil⁠—man or woman⁠—this spirit of evening-melancholy is!”</p>
				<p>Thus spake the old magician, looked cunningly about him, and then seized his harp.</p>
