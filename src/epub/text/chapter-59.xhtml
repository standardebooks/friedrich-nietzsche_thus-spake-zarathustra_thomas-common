				<p>“Into thine eyes gazed I lately, O Life: gold saw I gleam in thy night-eyes⁠—my heart stood still with delight:</p>
				<p>“⁠—A golden bark saw I gleam on darkened waters, a sinking, drinking, reblinking, golden swing-bark!</p>
				<p>“At my dance-frantic foot, dost thou cast a glance, a laughing, questioning, melting, thrown glance:</p>
				<p>“Twice only movedst thou thy rattle with thy little hands⁠—then did my feet swing with dance-fury.⁠—</p>
				<p>“My heels reared aloft, my toes they hearkened⁠—thee they would know: hath not the dancer his ear⁠—in his toe!</p>
				<p>“Unto thee did I spring: then fledst thou back from my bound; and towards me waved thy fleeing, flying tresses round!</p>
				<p>“Away from thee did I spring, and from thy snaky tresses: then stoodst thou there half-turned, and in thine eye caresses.</p>
				<p>“With crooked glances⁠—dost thou teach me crooked courses; on crooked courses learn my feet⁠—crafty fancies!</p>
				<p>“I fear thee near, I love thee far; thy flight allureth me, thy seeking secureth me:⁠—I suffer, but for thee, what would I not gladly bear!</p>
				<p>“For thee, whose coldness inflameth, whose hatred misleadeth, whose flight enchaineth, whose mockery⁠—pleadeth:</p>
				<p>“⁠—Who would not hate thee, thou great bindress, inwindress, temptress, seekress, findress! Who would not love thee, thou innocent, impatient, wind-swift, child-eyed sinner!</p>
				<p>“Whither pullest thou me now, thou paragon and tomboy? And now foolest thou me fleeing; thou sweet romp dost annoy!</p>
				<p>“I dance after thee, I follow even faint traces lonely. Where art thou? Give me thy hand! Or thy finger only!</p>
				<p>“Here are caves and thickets: we shall go astray!⁠—Halt! Stand still! Seest thou not owls and bats in fluttering fray?</p>
				<p>“Thou bat! Thou owl! Thou wouldst play me foul? Where are we? From the dogs hast thou learned thus to bark and howl.</p>
				<p>“Thou gnashest on me sweetly with little white teeth; thine evil eyes shoot out upon me, thy curly little mane from underneath!</p>
				<p>“This is a dance over stock and stone: I am the hunter⁠—wilt thou be my hound, or my chamois anon?</p>
				<p>“Now beside me! And quickly, wickedly springing! Now up! And over!⁠—Alas! I have fallen myself overswinging!</p>
				<p>“Oh, see me lying, thou arrogant one, and imploring grace! Gladly would I walk with thee⁠—in some lovelier place!</p>
				<p>“⁠—In the paths of love, through bushes variegated, quiet, trim! Or there along the lake, where goldfishes dance and swim!</p>
				<p>“Thou art now aweary? There above are sheep and sunset stripes: is it not sweet to sleep⁠—the shepherd pipes?</p>
				<p>“Thou art so very weary? I carry thee thither; let just thine arm sink! And art thou thirsty⁠—I should have something; but thy mouth would not like it to drink!⁠—</p>
				<p>“⁠—Oh, that cursed, nimble, supple serpent and lurking-witch! Where art thou gone? But in my face do I feel through thy hand, two spots and red blotches itch!</p>
				<p>“I am verily weary of it, ever thy sheepish shepherd to be. Thou witch, if I have hitherto sung unto thee, now shalt <em>thou</em>⁠—cry unto me!</p>
				<p>“To the rhythm of my whip shalt thou dance and cry! I forget not my whip?⁠—Not I!”⁠—</p>

				<p>Then did Life answer me thus, and kept thereby her fine ears closed:</p>
				<p>“O Zarathustra! Crack not so terribly with thy whip! Thou knowest surely that noise killeth thought⁠—and just now there came to me such delicate thoughts.</p>
				<p>“We are both of us genuine ne’er-do-wells and ne’er-do-ills. Beyond good and evil found we our island and our green meadow⁠—we two alone! Therefore must we be friendly to each other!</p>
				<p>“And even should we not love each other from the bottom of our hearts⁠—must we then have a grudge against each other if we do not love each other perfectly?</p>
				<p>“And that I am friendly to thee, and often too friendly, that knowest thou: and the reason is that I am envious of thy Wisdom. Ah, this mad old fool, Wisdom!</p>
				<p>“If thy Wisdom should one day run away from thee, ah! then would also my love run away from thee quickly.”⁠—</p>
				<p>Thereupon did Life look thoughtfully behind and around, and said softly: “O Zarathustra, thou art not faithful enough to me!</p>
				<p>“Thou lovest me not nearly so much as thou sayest; I know thou thinkest of soon leaving me.</p>
				<p>“There is an old heavy, heavy, booming-clock: it boometh by night up to thy cave:⁠—</p>
				<p>“⁠—When thou hearest this clock strike the hours at midnight, then thinkest thou between one and twelve thereon⁠—</p>
				<p>“⁠—Thou thinkest thereon, O Zarathustra, I know it⁠—of soon leaving me!”⁠—</p>
				<p>“Yea,” answered I, hesitatingly, “but thou knowest it also”⁠—And I said something into her ear, in amongst her confused, yellow, foolish tresses.</p>
				<p>“Thou <em>knowest</em> that, O Zarathustra? That knoweth no one⁠⸺”</p>
				<p>And we gazed at each other, and looked at the green meadow o’er which the cool evening was just passing, and we wept together.⁠—Then, however, was Life dearer unto me than all my Wisdom had ever been.⁠—</p>
				<p>Thus spake Zarathustra.</p>
