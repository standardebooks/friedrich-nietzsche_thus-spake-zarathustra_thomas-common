			<p>After this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a sower who hath scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love, and keep modest as a giver.</p>
			<p>Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.</p>
			<p>One morning, however, he awoke ere the rosy dawn, and having meditated long on his couch, at last spake thus to his heart:</p>
			<p>Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come to me, carrying a mirror?</p>
			<p>“O Zarathustra”⁠—said the child unto me⁠—“look at thyself in the mirror!”</p>
			<p>But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for not myself did I see therein, but a devil’s grimace and derision.</p>
			<p>Verily, all too well do I understand the dream’s portent and monition: my <em>doctrine</em> is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!</p>
			<p>Mine enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I gave them.</p>
			<p>Lost are my friends; the hour hath come for me to seek my lost ones!⁠—</p>
			<p>With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit inspireth. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.</p>
			<p>What hath happened unto me, mine animals?⁠—said Zarathustra. Am I not transformed? Hath not bliss come unto me like a whirlwind?</p>
			<p>Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too young⁠—so have patience with it!</p>
			<p>Wounded am I by my happiness: all sufferers shall be physicians unto me!</p>
			<p>To my friends can I again go down, and also to mine enemies! Zarathustra can again speak and bestow, and show his best love to his loved ones!</p>
			<p>My impatient love overfloweth in streams⁠—down towards sunrise and sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rusheth my soul into the valleys.</p>
			<p>Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long hath solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.</p>
			<p>Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.</p>
			<p>And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!</p>
			<p>Forsooth, there is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of my love beareth this along with it, down⁠—to the sea!</p>
			<p>New paths do I tread, a new speech cometh unto me; tired have I become⁠—like all creators⁠—of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on worn-out soles.</p>
			<p>Too slowly runneth all speaking for me:⁠—into thy chariot, O storm, do I leap! And even thee will I whip with my spite!</p>
			<p>Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Happy Isles where my friends sojourn;⁠—</p>
			<p>And mine enemies amongst them! How I now love everyone unto whom I may but speak! Even mine enemies pertain to my bliss.</p>
			<p>And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then doth my spear always help me up best: it is my foot’s ever ready servant:⁠—</p>
			<p>The spear which I hurl at mine enemies! How grateful am I to mine enemies that I may at last hurl it!</p>
			<p>Too great hath been the tension of my cloud: ’twixt laughters of lightnings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.</p>
			<p>Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm over the mountains: thus cometh its assuagement.</p>
			<p>Verily, like a storm cometh my happiness, and my freedom! But mine enemies shall think that <em>the evil one</em> roareth over their heads.</p>
			<p>Yea, ye also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and perhaps ye will flee therefrom, along with mine enemies.</p>
			<p>Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds’ flutes! Ah, that my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we already learned with one another!</p>
			<p>My wild wisdom became pregnant on the lonesome mountains; on the rough stones did she bear the youngest of her young.</p>
			<p>Now runneth she foolishly in the arid wilderness, and seeketh and seeketh the soft sward⁠—mine old, wild wisdom!</p>
			<p>On the soft sward of your hearts, my friends!⁠—on your love, would she fain couch her dearest one!⁠—</p>
			<p>Thus spake Zarathustra.</p>
