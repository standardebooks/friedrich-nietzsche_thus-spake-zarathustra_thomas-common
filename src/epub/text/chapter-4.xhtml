			</hgroup>
			<p>To the despisers of the body will I speak my word. I wish them neither to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own bodies⁠—and thus be dumb.</p>
			<p>“Body am I, and soul”⁠—so saith the child. And why should one not speak like children?</p>
			<p>But the awakened one, the knowing one, saith: “Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body.”</p>
			<p>The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.</p>
			<p>An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which thou callest “spirit”⁠—a little instrument and plaything of thy big sagacity.</p>
			<p>“Ego,” sayest thou, and art proud of that word. But the greater thing⁠—in which thou art unwilling to believe⁠—is thy body with its big sagacity; it saith not “ego,” but doeth it.</p>
			<p>What the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end in itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are the end of all things: so vain are they.</p>
			<p>Instruments and playthings are sense and spirit: behind them there is still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it hearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.</p>
			<p>Ever hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mastereth, conquereth, and destroyeth. It ruleth, and is also the ego’s ruler.</p>
			<p>Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, an unknown sage⁠—it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy body.</p>
			<p>There is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom. And who then knoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?</p>
			<p>Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. “What are these prancings and flights of thought unto me?” it saith to itself. “A byway to my purpose. I am the leading-string of the ego, and the prompter of its notions.”</p>
			<p>The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pain!” And thereupon it suffereth, and thinketh how it may put an end thereto⁠—and for that very purpose it <em>is meant</em> to think.</p>
			<p>The Self saith unto the ego: “Feel pleasure!” Thereupon it rejoiceth, and thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice⁠—and for that very purpose it <em>is meant</em> to think.</p>
			<p>To the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they despise is caused by their esteem. What is it that created esteeming and despising and worth and will?</p>
			<p>The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it created for itself joy and woe. The creating body created for itself spirit, as a hand to its will.</p>
			<p>Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, ye despisers of the body. I tell you, your very Self wanteth to die, and turneth away from life.</p>
			<p>No longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:⁠—create beyond itself. That is what it desireth most; that is all its fervour.</p>
			<p>But it is now too late to do so:⁠—so your Self wisheth to succumb, ye despisers of the body.</p>
			<p>To succumb⁠—so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye become despisers of the body. For ye can no longer create beyond yourselves.</p>
			<p>And therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth. And unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt.</p>
			<p>I go not your way, ye despisers of the body! Ye are no bridges for me to the Superman!⁠—</p>
			<p>Thus spake Zarathustra.</p>
