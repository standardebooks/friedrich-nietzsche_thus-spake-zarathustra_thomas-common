				<p>Here do I sit and wait, old broken tables around me and also new half-written tables. When cometh mine hour?</p>
				<p>—The hour of my descent, of my down-going: for once more will I go unto men.</p>
				<p>For that hour do I now wait: for first must the signs come unto me that it is <em>mine</em> hour⁠—namely, the laughing lion with the flock of doves.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile do I talk to myself as one who hath time. No one telleth me anything new, so I tell myself mine own story.</p>

				<p>When I came unto men, then found I them resting on an old infatuation: all of them thought they had long known what was good and bad for men.</p>
				<p>An old wearisome business seemed to them all discourse about virtue; and he who wished to sleep well spake of “good” and “bad” ere retiring to rest.</p>
				<p>This somnolence did I disturb when I taught that <em>no one yet knoweth</em> what is good and bad:⁠—unless it be the creating one!</p>
				<p>—It is he, however, who createth man’s goal, and giveth to the earth its meaning and its future: he only <em>effecteth</em> it <em>that</em> aught is good or bad.</p>
				<p>And I bade them upset their old academic chairs, and wherever that old infatuation had sat; I bade them laugh at their great moralists, their saints, their poets, and their Saviours.</p>
				<p>At their gloomy sages did I bid them laugh, and whoever had sat admonishing as a black scarecrow on the tree of life.</p>
				<p>On their great grave-highway did I seat myself, and even beside the carrion and vultures⁠—and I laughed at all their bygone and its mellow decaying glory.</p>
				<p>Verily, like penitential preachers and fools did I cry wrath and shame on all their greatness and smallness. Oh, that their best is so very small! Oh, that their worst is so very small! Thus did I laugh.</p>
				<p>Thus did my wise longing, born in the mountains, cry and laugh in me; a wild wisdom, verily!⁠—my great pinion-rustling longing.</p>
				<p>And oft did it carry me off and up and away and in the midst of laughter; then flew I quivering like an arrow with sun-intoxicated rapture:</p>
				<p>—Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived⁠—where gods in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes:</p>
				<p>(That I may speak in parables and halt and stammer like the poets: and verily I am ashamed that I have still to be a poet!)</p>
				<p>Where all becoming seemed to me dancing of Gods, and wantoning of Gods, and the world unloosed and unbridled and fleeing back to itself:⁠—</p>
				<p>—As an eternal self-fleeing and re-seeking of one another of many Gods, as the blessed self-contradicting, recommuning, and refraternising with one another of many Gods:⁠—</p>
				<p>Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, where necessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of freedom:⁠—</p>
				<p>Where I also found again mine old devil and arch-enemy, the spirit of gravity, and all that it created: constraint, law, necessity and consequence and purpose and will and good and evil:⁠—</p>
				<p>For must there not be that which is danced <em>over</em>, danced beyond? Must there not, for the sake of the nimble, the nimblest⁠—be moles and clumsy dwarfs?⁠—</p>

				<p>There was it also where I picked up from the path the word “Superman,” and that man is something that must be surpassed.</p>
				<p>—That man is a bridge and not a goal⁠—rejoicing over his noontides and evenings, as advances to new rosy dawns:</p>
				<p>—The Zarathustra word of the great noontide, and whatever else I have hung up over men like purple evening-afterglows.</p>
				<p>Verily, also new stars did I make them see, along with new nights; and over cloud and day and night, did I spread out laughter like a gay-coloured canopy.</p>
				<p>I taught them all <em>my</em> poetisation and aspiration: to compose and collect into unity what is fragment in man, and riddle and fearful chance;⁠—</p>
				<p>—As composer, riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance, did I teach them to create the future, and all that <em>hath been</em>⁠—to redeem by creating.</p>
				<p>The past of man to redeem, and every “It was” to transform, until the Will saith: “But so did I will it! So shall I will it⁠—”</p>
				<p>—This did I call redemption; this alone taught I them to call redemption.⁠⸺</p>
				<p>Now do I await <em>my</em> redemption⁠—that I may go unto them for the last time.</p>
				<p>For once more will I go unto men: <em>amongst</em> them will my sun set; in dying will I give them my choicest gift!</p>
				<p>From the sun did I learn this, when it goeth down, the exuberant one: gold doth it then pour into the sea, out of inexhaustible riches⁠—</p>
				<p>—So that the poorest fisherman roweth even with <em>golden</em> oars! For this did I once see, and did not tire of weeping in beholding it.⁠⸺</p>
				<p>Like the sun will also Zarathustra go down: now sitteth he here and waiteth, old broken tables around him, and also new tables⁠—half-written.</p>

				<p>Behold, here is a new table; but where are my brethren who will carry it with me to the valley and into hearts of flesh?⁠—</p>
				<p>Thus demandeth my great love to the remotest ones: <em>be not considerate of thy neighbour!</em> Man is something that must be surpassed.</p>
				<p>There are many diverse ways and modes of surpassing: see <em>thou</em> thereto! But only a buffoon thinketh: “man can also be <em>overleapt</em>.”</p>
				<p>Surpass thyself even in thy neighbour: and a right which thou canst seize upon, shalt thou not allow to be given thee!</p>
				<p>What thou doest can no one do to thee again. Lo, there is no requital.</p>
				<p>He who cannot command himself shall obey. And many a one <em>can</em> command himself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedience!</p>

				<p>Thus wisheth the type of noble souls: they desire to have nothing <em>gratuitously</em>, least of all, life.</p>
				<p>He who is of the populace wisheth to live gratuitously; we others, however, to whom life hath given itself⁠—we are ever considering <em>what</em> we can best give <em>in return</em>!</p>
				<p>And verily, it is a noble dictum which saith: “What life promiseth <em>us</em>, that promise will <em>we</em> keep⁠—to life!”</p>
				<p>One should not wish to enjoy where one doth not contribute to the enjoyment. And one should not <em>wish</em> to enjoy!</p>
				<p>For enjoyment and innocence are the most bashful things. Neither like to be sought for. One should <em>have</em> them⁠—but one should rather <em>seek</em> for guilt and pain!⁠—</p>

				<p>O my brethren, he who is a firstling is ever sacrificed. Now, however, are we firstlings!</p>
				<p>We all bleed on secret sacrificial altars, we all burn and broil in honour of ancient idols.</p>
				<p>Our best is still young: this exciteth old palates. Our flesh is tender, our skin is only lambs’ skin:⁠—how could we not excite old idol-priests!</p>
				<p><em>In ourselves</em> dwelleth he still, the old idol-priest, who broileth our best for his banquet. Ah, my brethren, how could firstlings fail to be sacrifices!</p>
				<p>But so wisheth our type; and I love those who do not wish to preserve themselves, the down-going ones do I love with mine entire love: for they go beyond.⁠—</p>

				<p>To be true⁠—that <em>can</em> few be! And he who can, will not! Least of all, however, can the good be true.</p>
				<p>Oh, those good ones! <em>Good men never speak the truth.</em> For the spirit, thus to be good, is a malady.</p>
				<p>They yield, those good ones, they submit themselves; their heart repeateth, their soul obeyeth: <em>he</em>, however, who obeyeth, <em>doth not listen to himself</em>!</p>
				<p>All that is called evil by the good, must come together in order that one truth may be born. O my brethren, are ye also evil enough for <em>this</em> truth?</p>
				<p>The daring venture, the prolonged distrust, the cruel Nay, the tedium, the cutting-into-the-quick⁠—how seldom do <em>these</em> come together! Out of such seed, however⁠—is truth produced!</p>
				<p><em>Beside</em> the bad conscience hath hitherto grown all <em>knowledge</em>! Break up, break up, ye discerning ones, the old tables!</p>

				<p>When the water hath planks, when gangways and railings o’erspan the stream, verily, he is not believed who then saith: “All is in flux.”</p>
				<p>But even the simpletons contradict him. “What?” say the simpletons, “all in flux? Planks and railings are still <em>over</em> the stream!</p>
				<p>“<em>Over</em> the stream all is stable, all the values of things, the bridges and bearings, all ‘good’ and ‘evil’: these are all <em>stable</em>!”⁠—</p>
				<p>Cometh, however, the hard winter, the stream-tamer, then learn even the wittiest distrust, and verily, not only the simpletons then say: “Should not everything⁠—<em>stand still</em>?”</p>
				<p>“Fundamentally standeth everything still”⁠—that is an appropriate winter doctrine, good cheer for an unproductive period, a great comfort for winter-sleepers and fireside-loungers.</p>
				<p>“Fundamentally standeth everything still”⁠—: but <em>contrary</em> thereto, preacheth the thawing wind!</p>
				<p>The thawing wind, a bullock, which is no ploughing bullock⁠—a furious bullock, a destroyer, which with angry horns breaketh the ice! The ice however⁠⸺<em>breaketh gangways</em>!</p>
				<p>O my brethren, is not everything <em>at present in flux</em>? Have not all railings and gangways fallen into the water? Who would still <em>hold on</em> to “good” and “evil”?</p>

				<p>There is an old illusion⁠—it is called good and evil. Around soothsayers and astrologers hath hitherto revolved the orbit of this illusion.</p>
				<p>Once did one <em>believe</em> in soothsayers and astrologers; and <em>therefore</em> did one believe, “Everything is fate: thou shalt, for thou must!”</p>
				<p>Then again did one distrust all soothsayers and astrologers; and <em>therefore</em> did one believe, “Everything is freedom: thou canst, for thou willest!”</p>

				<p>“Thou shalt not rob! Thou shalt not slay!”⁠—such precepts were once called holy; before them did one bow the knee and the head, and take off one’s shoes.</p>
				<p>But I ask you: Where have there ever been better robbers and slayers in the world than such holy precepts?</p>
				<p>Is there not even in all life⁠—robbing and slaying? And for such precepts to be called holy, was not <em>truth</em> itself thereby⁠—slain?</p>

				<p>It is my sympathy with all the past that I see it is abandoned⁠—</p>
				<p>—Abandoned to the favour, the spirit and the madness of every generation that cometh, and reinterpreteth all that hath been as its bridge!</p>
				<p>A great potentate might arise, an artful prodigy, who with approval and disapproval could strain and constrain all the past, until it became for him a bridge, a harbinger, a herald, and a cock-crowing.</p>
				<p>This however is the other danger, and mine other sympathy:⁠—he who is of the populace, his thoughts go back to his grandfather⁠—with his grandfather, however, doth time cease.</p>
				<p>Thus is all the past abandoned: for it might some day happen for the populace to become master, and drown all time in shallow waters.</p>
				<p>Therefore, O my brethren, a <em>new nobility</em> is needed, which shall be the adversary of all populace and potentate rule, and shall inscribe anew the word “noble” on new tables.</p>
				<p>For many noble ones are needed, and many kinds of noble ones, <em>for a new nobility</em>! Or, as I once said in parable: “That is just divinity, that there are Gods, but no God!”</p>

				<p>O my brethren, I consecrate you and point you to a new nobility: ye shall become procreators and cultivators and sowers of the future;⁠—</p>
				<p>—Verily, not to a nobility which ye could purchase like traders with traders’ gold; for little worth is all that hath its price.</p>
				<p>Let it not be your honour henceforth whence ye come, but whither ye go! Your Will and your feet which seek to surpass you⁠—let these be your new honour!</p>
				<p>Verily, not that ye have served a prince⁠—of what account are princes now!⁠—nor that ye have become a bulwark to that which standeth, that it may stand more firmly.</p>
				<p>Not that your family have become courtly at courts, and that ye have learned⁠—gay-coloured, like the flamingo⁠—to stand long hours in shallow pools:</p>
				<p>(For <em>ability</em>-to-stand is a merit in courtiers; and all courtiers believe that unto blessedness after death pertaineth⁠—<em>permission</em>-to-sit!)</p>
				<p>Nor even that a Spirit called Holy, led your forefathers into promised lands, which I do not praise: for where the worst of all trees grew⁠—the cross⁠—in that land there is nothing to praise!⁠—</p>
				<p>—And verily, wherever this “Holy Spirit” led its knights, always in such campaigns did⁠—goats and geese, and wryheads and guyheads run <em>foremost</em>!⁠—</p>
				<p>O my brethren, not backward shall your nobility gaze, but <em>outward</em>! Exiles shall ye be from all fatherlands and forefather-lands!</p>
				<p>Your <em>children’s land</em> shall ye love: let this love be your new nobility⁠—the undiscovered in the remotest seas! For it do I bid your sails search and search!</p>

				<p>“Why should one live? All is vain! To live⁠—that is to thrash straw; to live⁠—that is to burn oneself and yet not get warm.”⁠—</p>
				<p>Such ancient babbling still passeth for “wisdom”; because it is old, however, and smelleth mustily, <em>therefore</em> is it the more honoured. Even mould ennobleth.⁠—</p>
				<p>Children might thus speak: they <em>shun</em> the fire because it hath burnt them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.</p>
				<p>And he who ever “thrasheth straw,” why should he be allowed to rail at thrashing! Such a fool one would have to muzzle!</p>

				<p>Break up for me, O my brethren, break up also that <em>new</em> table! The weary-o’-the-world put it up, and the preachers of death and the jailer: for lo, it is also a sermon for slavery:⁠—</p>
				<p>Because they learned badly and not the best, and everything too early and everything too fast; because they <em>ate</em> badly: from thence hath resulted their ruined stomach;⁠—</p>
				<p>—For a ruined stomach, is their spirit: <em>it</em> persuadeth to death! For verily, my brethren, the spirit <em>is</em> a stomach!</p>
				<p>Life is a well of delight, but to him in whom the ruined stomach speaketh, the father of affliction, all fountains are poisoned.</p>
				<p>To discern: that is <em>delight</em> to the lion-willed! But he who hath become weary, is himself merely “willed”; with him play all the waves.</p>
				<p>And such is always the nature of weak men: they lose themselves on their way. And at last asketh their weariness: “Why did we ever go on the way? All is indifferent!”</p>
				<p><em>To them</em> soundeth it pleasant to have preached in their ears: “Nothing is worth while! Ye shall not will!” That, however, is a sermon for slavery.</p>

				<p>Ye shall only have foes to be hated; but not foes to be despised: ye must be proud of your foes. Thus have I already taught.</p>
				<p>For the worthier foe, O my brethren, shall ye reserve yourselves: therefore must ye pass by many a one⁠—</p>
				<p>—Especially many of the rabble, who din your ears with noise about people and peoples.</p>
				<p>Keep your eye clear of their For and Against! There is there much right, much wrong: he who looketh on becometh wroth.</p>
				<p>Therein viewing, therein hewing⁠—they are the same thing: therefore depart into the forests and lay your sword to sleep!</p>
				<p>Go <em>your</em> ways! and let the people and peoples go theirs!⁠—gloomy ways, verily, on which not a single hope glinteth any more!</p>
				<p>Let there the trader rule, where all that still glittereth is⁠—traders’ gold. It is the time of kings no longer: that which now calleth itself the people is unworthy of kings.</p>
				<p>See how these peoples themselves now do just like the traders: they pick up the smallest advantage out of all kinds of rubbish!</p>
				<p>They lay lures for one another, they lure things out of one another⁠—that they call “good neighbourliness.” O blessed remote period when a people said to itself: “I will be⁠—<em>master</em> over peoples!”</p>
				<p>For, my brethren, the best shall rule, the best also <em>willeth</em> to rule! And where the teaching is different, there⁠—the best is <em>lacking</em>.</p>

				<p>And better marriage-breaking than marriage-bending, marriage-lying!⁠—Thus spake a woman unto me: “Indeed, I broke the marriage, but first did the marriage break⁠—me!”</p>
				<p>The badly paired found I ever the most revengeful: they make everyone suffer for it that they no longer run singly.</p>
				<p>On that account want I the honest ones to say to one another: “We love each other: let us <em>see to it</em> that we maintain our love! Or shall our pledging be blundering?”</p>
				<p>—“Give us a set term and a small marriage, that we may see if we are fit for the great marriage! It is a great matter always to be twain.”</p>

				<p>For the earthquake⁠—it choketh up many wells, it causeth much languishing: but it bringeth also to light inner powers and secrets.</p>

				<p>And whoever calleth out: “Lo, here is a well for many thirsty ones, one heart for many longing ones, one will for many instruments”:⁠—around him collecteth a <em>people</em>, that is to say, many attempting ones.</p>

				<p>O my brethren! With whom lieth the greatest danger to the whole human future? Is it not with the good and just?⁠—</p>

				<p>And whatever harm the wicked may do, the harm of the good is the harmfulest harm!</p>
				<p>And whatever harm the world-maligners may do, the harm of the good is the harmfulest harm!</p>
				<p>O my brethren, into the hearts of the good and just looked someone once on a time, who said: “They are the Pharisees.” But people did not understand him.</p>
				<p>The good and just themselves were not free to understand him; their spirit was imprisoned in their good conscience. The stupidity of the good is unfathomably wise.</p>
				<p>It is the truth, however, that the good <em>must</em> be Pharisees⁠—they have no choice!</p>
				<p>The good <em>must</em> crucify him who deviseth his own virtue! That <em>is</em> the truth!</p>
				<p>The second one, however, who discovered their country⁠—the country, heart and soil of the good and just⁠—it was he who asked: “Whom do they hate most?”</p>
				<p>The <em>creator</em>, hate they most, him who breaketh the tables and old values, the breaker⁠—him they call the lawbreaker.</p>
				<p>For the good⁠—they <em>cannot</em> create; they are always the beginning of the end:⁠—</p>
				<p>—They crucify him who writeth new values on new tables, they sacrifice <em>unto themselves</em> the future⁠—they crucify the whole human future!</p>
				<p>The good⁠—they have always been the beginning of the end.⁠—</p>
