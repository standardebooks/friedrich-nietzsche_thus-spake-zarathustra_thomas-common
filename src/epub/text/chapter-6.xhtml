			</hgroup>
			<p>Ye do not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the animal hath bowed its head? Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed his head: out of his eye speaketh the great contempt.</p>
			<p>“Mine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego is to me the great contempt of man”: so speaketh it out of that eye.</p>
			<p>When he judged himself⁠—that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted one relapse again into his low estate!</p>
			<p>There is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself, unless it be speedy death.</p>
			<p>Your slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and in that ye slay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life!</p>
			<p>It is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom ye slay. Let your sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye justify your own survival!</p>
			<p>“Enemy” shall ye say but not “villain,” “invalid” shall ye say but not “wretch,” “fool” shall ye say but not “sinner.”</p>
			<p>And thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast done in thought, then would everyone cry: “Away with the nastiness and the virulent reptile!”</p>
			<p>But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another thing is the idea of the deed. The wheel of causality doth not roll between them.</p>
			<p>An idea made this pale man pale. Adequate was he for his deed when he did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.</p>
			<p>Evermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed. Madness, I call this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.</p>
			<p>The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck bewitched his weak reason. Madness <em>after</em> the deed, I call this.</p>
			<p>Hearken, ye judges! There is another madness besides, and it is <em>before</em> the deed. Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into this soul!</p>
			<p>Thus speaketh the red judge: “Why did this criminal commit murder? He meant to rob.” I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not booty: he thirsted for the happiness of the knife!</p>
			<p>But his weak reason understood not this madness, and it persuaded him. “What matter about blood!” it said; “wishest thou not, at least, to make booty thereby? Or take revenge?”</p>
			<p>And he hearkened unto his weak reason: like lead lay its words upon him⁠—thereupon he robbed when he murdered. He did not mean to be ashamed of his madness.</p>
			<p>And now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him, and once more is his weak reason so benumbed, so paralysed, and so dull.</p>
			<p>Could he only shake his head, then would his burden roll off; but who shaketh that head?</p>
			<p>What is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into the world through the spirit; there they want to get their prey.</p>
			<p>What is this man? A coil of wild serpents that are seldom at peace among themselves⁠—so they go forth apart and seek prey in the world.</p>
			<p>Look at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the poor soul interpreted to itself⁠—it interpreted it as murderous desire, and eagerness for the happiness of the knife.</p>
			<p>Him who now turneth sick, the evil overtaketh which is now the evil: he seeketh to cause pain with that which causeth him pain. But there have been other ages, and another evil and good.</p>
			<p>Once was doubt evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalid became a heretic or sorcerer; as heretic or sorcerer he suffered, and sought to cause suffering.</p>
			<p>But this will not enter your ears; it hurteth your good people, ye tell me. But what doth it matter to me about your good people!</p>
			<p>Many things in your good people cause me disgust, and verily, not their evil. I would that they had a madness by which they succumbed, like this pale criminal!</p>
			<p>Verily, I would that their madness were called truth, or fidelity, or justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in wretched self-complacency.</p>
			<p>I am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.⁠—</p>
			<p>Thus spake Zarathustra.</p>
