			<h2>FOURTH AND LAST PART.</h2>
			<p>Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the follies of the pitiful?</p>
			<p>Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their pity!</p>
			<p>Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: “Even God hath his hell: it is his love for man.”</p>
			<p>And lately did I hear him say these words: “God is dead: of his pity for man hath God died.”—ZARATHUSTRA, II., “The Pitiful.”</p>
